I have worked in journalism for nearly 10 years. In the past few, it's become hard to ignore that journalismâ€™s relationship with computer science has grown stronger. That fact makes it an exciting time to be a reporter with programming skills. I see a lot of potential in applying those skills to my work, enabling new ways to tell stories that inform my audience. 

Journalism and programming are similar in their quest for information and its interpretation, breaking it down into useful nuggets. Having grasped journalism's ways to look at data, I now want to learn how to analyze and manipulate it from a programming standpoint. I believe learning these skills will only enhance my reporting craft.

I can only hope my journalistic skills will inform this latest endeavor.
